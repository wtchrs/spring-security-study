# Chapter 13 - OAuth 2 authorization server

## Getting started

- Add an entry to your machine's /etc/hosts file: `127.0.0.1 auth-server`. This step is necessary to prevent session
  cookie from being overwritten between the authorization server and API client server when running both servers on your
  local PC.
